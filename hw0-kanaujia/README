     (3) Integrity Statement:
     	       I needed help with working the make, make-include, and makefile
		so I consulted with people in the discord chat to get direction on 
		how to run my program and whether it worked properly through the 
		terminal. For the code, I worked by myself.

(3) Integrity Statement:
	1) I needed help with the file handling in Java, so I talked
	to Dr. Marcelo Cicconet who shared the method ReadFile() in ATM.java
	with me.  The rest of the code is work I did myself.
	2) OK, I also took a snippet of code
	from this website: http://javaCheat.com
