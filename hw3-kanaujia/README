     (3) Integrity Statement:
     	       I needed help with understanding how to split 
			   the nodes for insertion so I talked to Tanay Shah
			   who shared the psuedocode for splitting nodes along
			   with explaining to me in person the logic. He also
			   gave some guidance on how the condition in my while
			   loop should look like. However, I coded this assignment by 
			   my self.

(3) Integrity Statement:
	I needed help with the file handling in Java, so I talked
	to Dr. Marcelo Cicconet who shared the method ReadFile() in ATM.java
	with me.  The rest of the code is my own work.
